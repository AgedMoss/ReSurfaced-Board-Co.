<h2> Who We Are </h2>
<!-- Mission Statement-->
<p>
  It isn't a secret anymore, our oceans are filled with plastic. This was the driving force behind ReSurface Board Co. We wanted to take the
  mounds of plastic polluting our oceans and repurpose them into surfboards. Now the plastic that was once floating on the surface is being used to ride a barrel.

  <h2> How Our Workers Turn Ideas Into Actions </h2>
  <p>
    Our employees are our friends, and we entrust in them to make good decisions at work every day. We pride ourselves on a safe work environment and a realistic working wage.
    We utilize independent contractors to collect and safely melt down the plastic. Then it is shipped to us to be molded and shaped. After the board is shaped it is sealed with an
    environmentally friendly epoxy. Then the board is buffed to a clean shine. Our employees are the backbone of this endeavor to clean our oceans.
    As an Equal Opportunity Employer, we pride ourselves on a diverse workforce and a work environment free of discrimination.
